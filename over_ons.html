    <h1>About us!</h1>
    <p>Welcome to our podcast Tune with lune! We are June and Lois and we are the creators of Tune with lune. We created this podcast because we both love music and wanted to share this with the world. We appreciate all kinds of music from classical to heavy metal, so naturally we will discuss various genres in our episodes and introduce you to underground subgenres. We offer fresh-takes, artist interviews, and in-depth reviews. Our goal is to inform our listeners about music and the history of it. We also want to introduce and motivate you to listen to genres you normally would not listen to.</p>

                <h2>Lois</h2>
                <p>Hi! I’m Lois, and I’m excited to be one of the voices behind our podcast! Music is my passion, and I love chatting about everything from big hits to hidden gems. I believe every song has a story to tell, and I’m here to help uncover those stories while having a blast. When I’m not podcasting, I’m usually digging through vinyl or hanging out with friends at local gigs. Let’s celebrate the music we love and discover some new favorites along the way!</p>

                <p>Hey there! I’m June, a music lover and the creative mind behind this podcast. I’m all about discovering new tunes and sharing the stories that make them special. Whether it’s a catchy indie track or a classic jam, I love diving into the vibes and emotions behind the music. When I’m not recording, you’ll probably find me jamming out at a concert or curating my next favorite playlist. </p>
